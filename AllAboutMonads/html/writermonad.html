<a name="motivation"><h2>Motivation</h2></a>

<p>It is often desirable for a computation to generate output
"on the side".  Logging and tracing are the most common examples
in which data is generated during a computation that we want to
retain but is not the primary result of the computation.
</p>

<p>Explicitly managing the logging or tracing data can clutter up
the code and invite subtle bugs such as missed log entries.
The Writer monad provides a cleaner way to manage the output
without cluttering the main computation.
</p>

<a name="definition"><h2>Definition</h2></a>

<p>
The definition shown here uses multi-parameter type classes
and funDeps, which are not standard Haskell 98.  It is not necessary
to fully understand these details to make use of the Writer monad.
</p>

<p>
<img src="info.png" align="left"></img>
To fully understand this definition, you need to know about Haskell's
<code>Monoid</code> class, which represents a mathematical structure
called a <def>monoid</def> in the same way that the <code>Monad</code>
class represents the monad structure.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that monoids are simpler than monads.  A monoid
is a set of objects, a single identity element, and an associative binary operator
over the set of objects.  A monoid must obey some mathematical laws,
such that applying the operator to any values from the set gives another
value in the set, and whenever one operand of the operator is the identity
element the result is equal to the other operand.  You may notice that
these laws are the same as the laws governing <code>mzero</code> and
<code>mplus</code> for instances of <code>MonadPlus</code>.  That is because
monads with a zero and plus are monads that are also monoids!
</p>

<p>
Some examples of mathematical monoids are the natural numbers with
identity element 0 and binary operator for addition, and also the
natural numbers with identity element 1 and binary operator for multiplication. 
</p>

<p>
In Haskell, a monoid consists of a type, an identity element,
and a binary operator.  Haskell defines the <code>Monoid</code> class 
(in Data.Monoid) to provide a standard convention for working with monoids:
the identity element is named <code>mempty</code> and the operator is named
<code>mappend</code>.
</p>

<p>
The most commonly used standard monoid in Haskell is
the list, but functions of type <code>(a&nbsp;->&nbsp;a)</code> also form a monoid.
</p>

<p>
<img src="warn.png" align="left"></img>
Care should be taken when using a list as the monoid for a Writer, as there may
be a performance penalty associated with the <code>mappend</code> operation
as the output grows.  In that case, a data structure that supports fast
append operations would be a more appropriate choice.
</p>

<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
newtype Writer w a = Writer { runWriter :: (a,w) } 
 
instance (Monoid w) => Monad (Writer w) where 
    return a             = Writer (a,mempty) 
    (Writer (a,w)) >>= f = let (a',w') = runWriter $ f a in Writer (a',w `mappend` w')
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
The Writer monad maintains a (value,log) pair, where the log type must be
a monoid.  The <code>return</code> function simply returns the value
along with an empty log.  Binding executes the bound function using the current
value as input, and appends any log output to the existing log.
</p>

<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
class (Monoid w, Monad m) => MonadWriter w m | m -> w where 
    pass   :: m (a,w -> w) -> m a 
    listen :: m a -> m (a,w) 
    tell   :: w -> m () 
 
instance (Monoid w) => MonadWriter (Writer w) where 
    pass   (Writer ((a,f),w)) = Writer (a,f w) 
    listen (Writer (a,w))     = Writer ((a,w),w) 
    tell   s                  = Writer ((),s) 
 
listens :: (MonadWriter w m) => (w -> w) -> m a -> m (a,w) 
listens f m = do (a,w) <- m; return (a,f w)
 
censor :: (MonadWriter w m) => (w -> w) -> m a -> m a 
censor f m = pass $ do a <- m; return (a,f)
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
The <code>MonadWriter</code> class provides a number of convenience functions
for working with Writer monads.  The simplest and most useful is <code>tell</code>,
which adds one or more entries to the log.  The <code>listen</code> function
turns a Writer that returns a value <code>a</code> and produces output <code>w</code>
into a Writer that produces a value <code>(a,w)</code> and still produces output
<code>w</code>.  This allows the computation to "listen" to the log output
generated by a Writer.
</p>

<p>
The <code>pass</code> function is slightly more complicated.  It converts a
Writer that produces a value <code>(a,f)</code> and output <code>w</code>
into a Writer that produces a value <code>a</code> and output <code>f w</code>.
This is somewhat cumbersome, so the helper function <code>censor</code> is
normally used.  The <code>censor</code> function takes a function and
a Writer and produces a new Writer whose output is the same but whose log
entry has been modified by the function.
</p>

<p>
The <code>listens</code> function operates just like <code>listen</code>
except that the log part of the value is modified by the supplied function.
</p>

<a name="example"><h2>Example</h2></a>

<p>
In this example, we imagine a very simple firewall that filters packets
based on a rulebase of rules matching the source and destination hosts
and the payload of the packet.  The firewall's primary job is packet
filtering, but we would also like it to produce a log of its activity.

<p>
That was pretty simple, but what if we want to merge duplicate consecutive
log entries?  None of the existing functions allow us to modify the output
from previous stages of the computation, but we can use a "delayed logging"
trick to only add a log entry only after we get a new entry that doesn't match
the ones before it.
