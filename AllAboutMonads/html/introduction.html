<a name="what"><h2>What is a monad?</h2></a>

<p>
A monad is a way to structure computations in terms of values and sequences
of computations using those values.  Monads allow
the programmer to build up computations using sequential building blocks,
which can themselves be sequences of computations.  The monad determines how
combined computations form a new computation and frees the programmer from
having to code the combination manually each time it is required.
</p>

<p>
<em>It is useful to think of a monad as a strategy for combining computations
into more complex computations.</em>  For example, you should be familiar with
the <code>Maybe</code> type in Haskell:
<pre>
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
</pre>
which represents the type of computations which may fail to return a result.
The <code>Maybe</code> type suggests a strategy for combining computations
which return <code>Maybe</code> values: if a combined computation consists
of one computation <code>B</code> that depends on the result of another
computation <code>A</code>, then the combined computation should yield
<code>Nothing</code> whenever either <code>A</code> or <code>B</code> yield
<code>Nothing</code> and the combined computation should yield the result
of <code>B</code> applied to the result of <code>A</code> when both
computations succeed.
</p>

<p>
Other monads exist for building computations that perform I/O, have state,
may return multiple results, etc.  There are as many different type of monads
as there are strategies for combining computations, but there are certain
monads that are especially useful and are common enough that they are part of
the standard <a href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinelibrary/">Haskell 98 libraries</a>.
These monads are each described in <a href="introII.html">Part II</a>.
</p>

<a name="why"><h2>Why should I make the effort to understand monads?</h2></a>

<p>
The sheer number of different <a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/bookshelf/#monads">
monad tutorials</a> on the internet is a good
indication of the difficulty many people have understanding the concept.
This is due to the abstract nature of monads and to the fact that they
are used in several different capacities, which can confuse the picture
of exactly what a monad is and what it is good for.
</p>

<p>
In Haskell, monads play a central role in the I/O system.  It is not
essential to understand monads to do I/O in Haskell, but understanding
the I/O monad will improve your code and extend your capabilities.
</p>

<p>
For the programmer, monads are useful tools for structuring functional programs.
They have three properties that make them especially useful:
<ol>
	<li>Modularity - They allow computations to be composed from simpler
	    computations and separate the combination strategy from the
	    actual computations being performed.
	</li>
	<li>Flexibility - They allow functional programs to be much more adaptable
	    than equivalent programs written without monads.  This is because the
	    monad distills the computational strategy into a single place instead
	    of requiring it be distributed throughout the entire program. 
	</li>
	<li>Isolation - They can be used to create imperative-style computational
	    structures which remain safely isolated from the main body of the functional
	    program.  This is useful for incorporating side-effects (such as I/O) and
	    state (which violates referential transparency) into a pure functional
	    language like Haskell.
	</li>
</ol>
Each of these features will be revisited later in the tutorial in the context
of specific monads.
