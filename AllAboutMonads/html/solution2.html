<h1>Solution to <a href="exercises.html#exercise2">Exercise 2</a></h1>

<p>
The two choices for a parent are the mother and the father, suggesting
a straightforward implementation of the <code>parent</code> function
using the <code>mplus</code> operator:
</p>

<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%">
<tr bgcolor="#aabb55">
<th align="left">Code available in <a href="../examples/exercise2.hs">exercise2.hs</a></th>
</tr>
<tr><td><pre>
parent :: Sheep -> Maybe Sheep
parent s = (mother s) `mplus` (father s)
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
In this case, the <code>mplus</code> operator is used to combine the
values from the monadic functions <code>mother</code> and
<code>father</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>grandparent</code> function is a little trickier.  You might
be tempted to simply write:
</p>

<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%">
<tr><td><pre>
grandparent s = do p <- parent s
                   parent p
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
but this is not correct.  To see why not, you must remember that 
the <code>mplus</code> operator in the Maybe monad
returns its first argument unless it is <code>Nothing</code>, in
which case it returns its second argument.  Imagine what would happen
if the sheep had a mother without parents but a father with parents.
Then <code>p</code> would be the mother and <code>parent p</code>
would be <code>Nothing</code>, even though there are grandparents on
the father's side.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that there is no back-tracking
facility in the Maybe monad's strategy for <code>mplus</code>.
We can get around this by carefully defining the
<code>grandparent</code> function so that no backtracking is required:
<p>

<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%">
<tr bgcolor="#aabb55">
<th align="left">Code available in <a href="../examples/exercise2.hs">exercise2.hs</a></th>
</tr>
<tr><td><pre>
grandparent :: Sheep -> Maybe Sheep
grandparent s = (mother s >>= parent) `mplus` (father s >>= parent)
</pre></td></tr></table>
