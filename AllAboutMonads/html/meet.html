<p>We will use the <code>Maybe</code> type constructor
throughout this chapter, so you should familiarize yourself with the
definition and usage of
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinelibrary/maybe.html">
<code>Maybe</code></a> before continuing.
</p>

<a name="typeconstructors"><h2>Type constructors</h2></a>

<p>
To understand monads in Haskell, you need to be comfortable dealing with
type constructors.  A <em>type constructor</em> is a parameterized type
definition used with polymorphic types.  By supplying a type constructor
with one or more concrete types, you can construct a new concrete type
in Haskell.  In the definition of <code>Maybe</code>:
<pre>
  data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
</pre>
<code>Maybe</code> is a type constructor and <code>Nothing</code>
and <code>Just</code> are data constructors.  You can construct a data value
by applying the <code>Just</code> data constructor to a value:
<pre>
  country = Just "China"
</pre>
In the same way, you can construct a type by applying the <code>Maybe</code> 
type constructor to a type:
<pre>
  lookupAge :: DB -> String -> Maybe Int
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Polymorphic types are like containers that are capable of holding values
of many different types.  So <code>Maybe Int</code> can be thought of as
a <code>Maybe</code> container holding an <code>Int</code> value (or
<code>Nothing</code>) and <code>Maybe String</code> would be a <code>Maybe</code>
container holding a <code>String</code> value (or <code>Nothing</code>).
In Haskell, we can also make the type of the container polymorphic, so we
could write "<code>m a</code>" to represent a container of some type holding
a value of some type!
</p>

<p>
We often use type variables with type constructors to describe abstract features
of a computation.  For example, the polymorphic type <code>Maybe a</code> is
the type of all computations that may return a value or <code>Nothing</code>.
In this way, we can talk about the properties of the container apart from any
details of what the container might hold.
</p>

<p>

If you get messages about "kind errors" from the compiler when working with
monads, it means that you are not using the type constructors correctly.
<br clear="all"></p>

<a name="maybe"><h2>Maybe a monad</h2></a>

<p>In Haskell a monad is represented as a type constructor
(call it <code>m</code>), a function that builds values of that type
(<code>a&nbsp;->&nbsp;m&nbsp;a</code>), and a function that combines values
of that type with computations that produce values of that type to
produce a new computation for values of that type
(<code>m&nbsp;a&nbsp;->&nbsp;(a&nbsp;->&nbsp;m&nbsp;b)&nbsp;->&nbsp;m&nbsp;b</code>).
Note that the container is the same, but the type of the contents of the container
can change.  It is customary to call the monad type constructor "<code>m</code>" when
discussing monads in general.  The function that builds values of that
type is traditionally called "<code>return</code>" and the third function is known
as "bind" but is written "<code>>>=</code>".  The signatures of the functions are:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
-- the type of monad m
data m a = ... 

-- return is a type constructor that creates monad instances 
return :: a -> m a

-- bind is a function that combines a monad instance m a with a computation
-- that produces another monad instance m b from a's to produce a new
-- monad instance m b
(>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
Roughly speaking, the monad type constructor defines a type of computation, the
<code>return</code> function creates primitive values of that
computation type and <code>>>=</code> combines computations of that
type together to make more complex computations of that type.  
Using the container analogy, the type constructor <code>m</code> is a
container that can hold different values.  <code>m a</code> is a container holding
a value of type <code>a</code>.  The <code>return</code> function
puts a value into a monad container.  The <code>>>=</code> function
takes the value from a monad container and passes it to a function to
produce a monad container containing a new value, possibly of a different
type.  The <code>>>=</code> function is known as "bind" because it
binds the value in a monad container to the first argument of a
function.  By adding logic to the binding function, a monad can implement
a specific strategy for combining computations in the monad.
</p>

<p>
This will all become clearer after the example below, but if you feel
particularly confused at this point you might try looking at
this <a href="analogy.html">physical analogy of a monad</a>
before continuing.
</p>

<a name="example1"><h2>An example</h2></a>

<p>
Suppose that we are writing a program to keep track of sheep cloning
experiments.  We would certainly want to know the genetic history of all
of our sheep, so we would need <code>mother</code> and <code>father</code>
functions.  But since these are cloned sheep, they may not always have both a
mother and a father!
</p>

<p>
We would represent the possibility of not having a mother or father
using the <code>Maybe</code> type constructor in our Haskell code:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
type Sheep = ...

father :: Sheep -> Maybe Sheep
father = ...

mother :: Sheep -> Maybe Sheep
mother = ...
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
Then, defining functions to find grandparents is a little more complicated,
because we have to handle the possibility of not having a parent:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
maternalGrandfather :: Sheep -> Maybe Sheep
maternalGrandfather s = case (mother s) of
                          Nothing -> Nothing
                          Just m  -> father m
</pre></td></tr></table>
and so on for the other grandparent combinations.
</p>

<p>
It gets even worse if we want to find great grandparents:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
mothersPaternalGrandfather :: Sheep -> Maybe Sheep
mothersPaternalGrandfather s = case (mother s) of
                                 Nothing -> Nothing
                                 Just m  -> case (father m) of
                                              Nothing -> Nothing
                                              Just gf -> father gf
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
Aside from being ugly, unclear, and difficult to maintain, this is
just too much work.  It is clear that a <code>Nothing</code> value at
any point in the computation will cause <code>Nothing</code> to be the
final result, and it would be much nicer to implement this notion
once in a single place and remove all of the explicit <code>case</code>
testing scattered all over the code.  This will make the code easier
to write, easier to read and easier to change.  So good programming
style would have us create a combinator that captures the behavior
we want:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%">
<tr bgcolor="#aabb55">
<th align="left">Code available in <a href="../examples/example1.hs">example1.hs</a></th>
</tr>
<tr><td><pre>
-- comb is a combinator for sequencing operations that return Maybe
comb :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
comb Nothing  _ = Nothing
comb (Just x) f = f x

-- now we can use `comb` to build complicated sequences
mothersPaternalGrandfather :: Sheep -> Maybe Sheep
mothersPaternalGrandfather s = (Just s) `comb` mother `comb` father `comb` father 
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>The combinator is a huge success!  The code is much cleaner and easier
to write, understand and modify.  Notice also that the <code>comb</code> function
is entirely polymorphic &mdash; it is not specialized for <code>Sheep</code> in any
way.  In fact, <em>the combinator captures a general strategy for combining
computations that may fail to return a value.</em>  Thus, we can apply the
same combinator to other computations that may fail to return a value,
such as database queries or dictionary lookups.
</p>

<p>
The happy outcome is that common sense programming practice has led us to
create a monad without even realizing it.  The <code>Maybe</code> type
constructor along with the <code>Just</code> function
(acts like <code>return</code>) and our combinator (acts like <code>>>=</code>)
together form a simple monad for building computations which may not return
a value.  All that remains to make this monad truly useful is to
make it conform to the monad framework built into the Haskell language.
That is the subject of the next chapter.
</p>

<a name="list"><h2>A list is also a monad</h2></a>

<p>
We have seen that the <code>Maybe</code> type constructor is a monad
for building computations which may fail to return a value.  You may
be surprised to know that another common Haskell type constructor,
<code>[]</code> (for building lists), is also a monad.  The List monad
allows us to build computations which can return 0, 1, or more values.
</p> 

<p>
The <code>return</code> function for lists simply creates a singleton list
(<code>return&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;[x]</code>).  The binding operation
for lists creates a new list containing the results of applying the function
to all of the values in the original list
(<code>l&nbsp;>>=&nbsp;f&nbsp;=&nbsp;concatMap&nbsp;f&nbsp;l</code>).
</p>

<p>
One use of functions which return lists is to represent
<em>ambiguous</em> computations &mdash; that is computations which may
have 0, 1, or more allowed outcomes.  In a computation composed from
ambigous subcomputations, the ambiguity may compound, or it may
eventually resolve into a single allowed outcome or no allowed outcome
at all.  During this process, the set of possible computational states
is represented as a list.  The List monad thus embodies a strategy for
performing simultaneous computations along all allowed paths of an
ambiguous computation.
</p>

<p>
Examples of this use of the List monad, and contrasting examples using
the Maybe monad will be presented shortly.  But first, we must see how
useful monads are defined in Haskell.
</p>

<a name="summary"><h2>Summary</h2></a>

<p>
We have seen that a monad is a type constructor, a function called
<code>return</code>, and a combinator function called <code>bind</code>
or <code>>>=</code>.  These three elements work together to encapsulate
a strategy for combining computations to produce more complex computations.
</p>

<p>
Using the <code>Maybe</code> type constructor, we saw how good programming
practice led us to define a simple monad that could be used to build complex
computations out of sequences of computations that could each fail to return a
value.  The resulting <code>Maybe</code> monad encapsulates a strategy for
combining computations that may not return values.  By codifying the strategy
in a monad, we have achieved a degree of modularity and flexibility that
is not present when the computations are combined in an ad hoc manner.
</p>

<p>
We have also seen that another common Haskell type constructor, <code>[]</code>,
is a monad.  The List monad encapsulates a strategy for combining computations
that can return 0, 1, or multiple values.
