<h1>Introduction</h1>

<hr align="center" size="1" width="80%">

<p>
Part I has introduced the monad concept and Part II has provided an understanding
of a number of common, useful monads in the standard Haskell libraries.  This
is not enough to put monads into heavy practice, however, because in the real world
you often want computations which combine aspects of more than one
monad at the same time, such as stateful, non-determistic computations or
computations which make use of continuations and perform I/O.  When one computation
is a strict subset of the other, it is possible to perform the monad computations
separately, unless the sub-computation is performed in a one-way monad.
</p>

<p>
Often, the computations can't be performed in isolation.  In this case, what
is needed is a monad that combines the features of the two monads into a single
computation.  It is inefficient and poor practice to write a new monad instance
with the required characteristics each time a new combination is desired.  Instead,
we would prefer to develop a way to combine the standard monads to produce
the needed hybrids.  The technique that lets us do exactly that is
called <dfn>monad transformers</dfn>.
</p>

<p>
Monad transformers are the topic of Part III, and they are explained by revisiting
earlier examples to see how monad transformers can be used to add more realistic
capabilities to them.  It may be helpful to review the earlier examples as
they are re-examined.
