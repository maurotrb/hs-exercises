<a name="classes"><h2>Haskell type classes</h2></a>

<p>
The discussion in this chapter involves the Haskell type class system.
If you are not familiar with type classes in Haskell, you should
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/classes.html">review them</a>
before continuing.
</p>

<a name="monad"><h2>The Monad class </h2></a>

<p>
In Haskell, there is a standard <code>Monad</code> class that defines the names
and signatures of the two monad functions <code>return</code> and
<code>>>=</code>.  It is not strictly necessary to make your monads
instances of the <code>Monad</code> class, but it is a good idea.  Haskell has
special support for <code>Monad</code> instances built into the language and
making your monads instances of the <code>Monad</code> class will allow
you to use these features to write cleaner and more elegant code.  Also,
making your monads instances of the <code>Monad</code> class communicates
important information to others who read the code and failing to do so can
cause you to use confusing and non-standard function names.  It's easy to do
and it has many benefits, so just do it!
</p>

<p>The standard <code>Monad</code> class definition in Haskell looks
something like this:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
class Monad m where
    (>>=)  :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
    return :: a -> m a
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>

<a name="example2"><h2>Example continued</h2></a>

<p>
Continuing the <a href="meet.html#example1">previous example</a>, we will
now see how the <code>Maybe</code> type constructor fits into the Haskell monad
framework as an instance of the <code>Monad</code> class.
</p>

<p>
Recall that our <code>Maybe</code> monad used the <code>Just</code>
data constructor to fill the role of the monad <code>return</code> function
and we built a simple combinator to fill the role of the monad <code>>>=</code>
binding function.  We can make its role as a monad explicit
by declaring <code>Maybe</code> as an instance of the <code>Monad</code> class:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
instance Monad Maybe where
    Nothing  >>= f = Nothing
    (Just x) >>= f = f x
    return         = Just
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
Once we have defined <code>Maybe</code> as an instance of the
</code>Monad</code> class, we can use the standard monad operators to
build the complex computations:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
-- we can use monadic operations to build complicated sequences
maternalGrandfather :: Sheep -> Maybe Sheep
maternalGrandfather s = (return s) >>= mother >>= father

fathersMaternalGrandmother :: Sheep -> Maybe Sheep
fathersMaternalGrandmother s = (return s) >>= father >>= mother >>= mother 
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
In Haskell, <code>Maybe</code> is defined as an instance of the <code>Monad</code>
class in the standard prelude, so you don't need to do it yourself.
The other monad we have seen so far, the list constructor, is also defined as an
instance of the <code>Monad</code> class in the standard prelude.
</p>

<p>
<img src="info.png" align="left"></img>
When writing functions that work with monads, try to make use of the
<code>Monad</code> class instead of using a specific monad instance.
A function of the type
<pre>doSomething :: (Monad m) => a -> m b</pre>
is much more flexible than one of the type
<pre>doSomething :: a -> Maybe b</pre>
The former function can be used with many types of monads to get
different behavior depending on the strategy embodied in the monad,
whereas the latter function is restricted to the strategy of the
<code>Maybe</code> monad.
</p>

<a name="donotation"><h2>Do notation</h2></a>

<p>
Using the standard monadic function names is good, but another advantage
of membership in the <code>Monad</code> class is the Haskell support for
"do" notation.  Do notation is an expressive shorthand for building up
monadic computations, similar to the way that list comprehensions are an
expressive shorthand for building computations on lists.  Any instance of
the <code>Monad</code> class can be used in a do-block in Haskell.
</p>

<p>
In short, the do notation allows you to write monadic computations using
a pseudo-imperative style with named variables.  The result of a
monadic computation can be "assigned" to a variable using a left
arrow <code>&lt;-</code> operator.  Then using that variable in a
subsequent monadic computation automatically performs
the binding.  The type of the expression to the right of the arrow is
a monadic type <code>m a</code>.  The expression to the left of the arrow
is a pattern to be matched against the value <em>inside</em> the monad.
<code>(x:xs)</code> would match against <code>Maybe [1,2,3]</code>, for example.
</p>

<p>
Here is a sample of do notation using the <code>Maybe</code> monad:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%">
<tr bgcolor="#aabb55">
<th align="left">Code available in <a href="../examples/example2.hs">example2.hs</a></th>
</tr>
<tr><td><pre>
-- we can also use do-notation to build complicated sequences
mothersPaternalGrandfather :: Sheep -> Maybe Sheep
mothersPaternalGrandfather s = do m  <- mother s
                                  gf <- father m
                                  father gf
</pre></td></tr></table>
Compare this to <code>fathersMaternalGrandmother</code> written above without
using do notation.
</p>

<p>
The do block shown above is written using the layout rule to define the extent of
the block.  Haskell also allows you to use braces and semicolons when defining
a do block: 
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
mothersPaternalGrandfather s = do { m <- mother s; gf <- father m; father gf }
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
Notice that do notation resembles an imperative programming language,
in which a computation is built up from an explicit sequence of
simpler computations.  In this respect, monads offer the possibility to
create imperative-style computations within a larger functional program.
This theme will be expanded upon when we deal with side-effects and
the I/O monad later.
</p>

<p>
Do notation is simply syntactic sugar.  There is nothing that can be done using
do notation that cannot be done using only the standard monadic operators.
But do notation is cleaner and more convenient in some cases, especially when
the sequence of monadic computations is long.  You should understand both the
standard monadic binding notation and do notation and be able to apply each
where they are appropriate.
</p>

<p>
The actual translation from do notation to standard monadic operators is roughly
that every expression matched to a pattern, <code>x <- expr1</code>, becomes
<pre>expr1 >>= \x -></pre> and every expression without a variable assignment,
<code>expr2</code> becomes <pre>expr2 >>= \_ -></pre>  All do blocks must
end with a monadic expression, and a let clause is allowed at the beginning of a
do block (but let clauses in do blocks do not use the "in" keyword).
The definition of <code>mothersPaternalGrandfather</code> above would be
translated to:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
mothersPaternalGrandfather s = mother s >>= \m ->
                               father m >>= \gf ->
                               father gf
</pre></td></tr></table>
It now becomes clear why the binding operator is so named.  It is
literally used to bind the value in the monad to the argument in the
following lambda expression.
</p>

<a name="summary"><h2>Summary</h2></a>

<p>
Haskell provides built-in support for monads.  To take advantage of Haskell's
monad support, you must declare the monad type constructor to be an instance
of the <code>Monad</code> class and supply definitions of the <code>return</code> and
<code>>>=</code> (pronounced "bind") functions for the monad. 
</p>

<p>
A monad that is an instance of the <code>Monad</code> class can be used
with do-notation, which is syntactic sugar that provides a simple,
imperative-style notation for describing computations with monads.
