<p>
The tutorial up to now has avoided technical discussions, but there are
a few technical points that must be made concerning monads.  Monadic
operations must obey a set of laws, known as "the monad axioms".
These laws aren't enforced by the Haskell compiler, so it is up to
the programmer to ensure that any <code>Monad</code> instances he
declares obey they laws.  Haskell's <code>Monad</code> class also
includes some functions beyond the minimal complete definition
that we have not seen yet.  Finally, many monads obey additional
laws beyond the standard monad laws, and there is an additional
Haskell class to support these extended monads.
</p>

<a name="laws"><h2>The three fundamental laws</h2></a>

<p>
The concept of a monad comes from a branch of mathematics called
category theory.  While it is not necessary to know category theory
to create and use monads, we do need to obey a small bit of mathematical
formalism.  To create a monad, it is not enough just to declare a Haskell
instance of the <code>Monad</code> class with the correct type signatures.
To be a proper monad, the <code>return</code> and <code>>>=</code> functions
must work together according to three laws:
<ol>
<li><code>(return x) >>= f == f x</code></li>
<li><code>m >>= return == m</code></li>
<li><code>(m >>= f) >>= g == m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)</code></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The first law requires that <code>return</code> is a left-identity with respect
to <code>>>=</code>.  The second law requires that <code>return</code> is a
right-identity with respect to <code>>>=</code>.  The third law is a kind
of associativity law for <code>>>=</code>.  Obeying the three laws ensures
that the semantics of the do-notation using the monad will be consistent.
</p>

<p>
Any type constructor with return and bind operators that satisfy the three
monad laws is a monad.  In Haskell, the compiler does not check that the laws
hold for every instance of the <code>Monad</code> class.  It is up to the
programmer to ensure that any <code>Monad</code> instance he creates
satisfies the monad laws.
</p>

<a name="fail"><h2>Failure IS an option</h2></a>

<p>
The definition of the <code>Monad</code> class given
<a href="class.html#monad">earlier</a> showed only the minimal complete
definition.  The full definition of the <code>Monad</code> class
actually includes two additional functions: <code>fail</code> and <code>>></code>.
</p>

<p>
The default implementation of the <code>fail</code> function is:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
fail s = error s
</pre></td></tr></table>  
You do not need to change this for your monad unless you want to
provide different behavior for failure or to incorporate failure
into the computational strategy of your monad.  The <code>Maybe</code>
monad, for instance, defines <code>fail</code> as:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
fail _ = Nothing
</pre></td></tr></table>  
so that <code>fail</code> returns an instance of the <code>Maybe</code>
monad with meaningful behavior when it is bound with other functions
in the <code>Maybe</code> monad.
</p>

<p>
The <code>fail</code> function is not a required part of the
mathematical definition of a monad, but it is included in the
standard <code>Monad</code> class definition because of the role
it plays in Haskell's do notation.  The <code>fail</code> function
is called whenever a pattern matching failure occurs in a do block:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
fn :: Int -> Maybe [Int]
fn idx = do let l = [Just [1,2,3], Nothing, Just [], Just [7..20]]
            (x:xs) <- l!!idx   -- a pattern match failure will call "fail"
            return xs
</pre></td></tr></table>  
So in the code above, <code>fn 0</code> has the value <code>Just [2,3]</code>,
but <code>fn 1</code> and <code>fn 2</code> both have the value <code>Nothing</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>>></code> function is a convenience operator that is used
to bind a monadic computation that does not require input from the
previous computation in the sequence.  It is defined in terms of <code>>>=</code>:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
(>>) :: m a -> m b -> m b
m >> k = m >>= (\_ -> k)
</pre></td></tr></table>  
</p>

<a name="nowayout"><h2>No way out</h2></a>

<p>
You might have noticed that there is no way to get values
out of a monad as defined in the standard <code>Monad</code> class.
That is not an accident.  Nothing prevents the monad author from
allowing it using functions specific to the monad.  For instance,
values can be extracted from the <code>Maybe</code> monad by pattern
matching on <code>Just x</code> or using the <code>fromJust</code>
function.
</p>

<p>
By not requiring such a function, the Haskell <code>Monad</code>
class allows the creation of <dfn>one-way</dfn> monads.  One-way
monads allow values to enter the monad through the <code>return</code>
function (and sometimes the <code>fail</code> function) and they
allow computations to be performed within the monad using the bind
functions <code>>>=</code> and <code>>></code>, but they do not
allow values back out of the monad.
</p>

<p>
The <code>IO</code> monad is a familiar example of a one-way monad in Haskell.
Because you can't escape from the <code>IO</code> monad, it is impossible to write
a function that does a computation in the <code>IO</code> monad but whose result
type does not include the <code>IO</code> type constructor.  This means that
<em>any</em> function whose result type does not contain the <code>IO</code> type
constructor is guaranteed not to use the <code>IO</code> monad.
Other monads, such as <code>List</code> and <code>Maybe</code>,
do allow values out of the monad.  So it is possible to write functions which
use these monads internally but return non-monadic values.
</p>

<p>
<em>The wonderful feature of a one-way monad is that it can support
side-effects in its monadic operations but prevent them from
destroying the functional properties of the non-monadic
portions of the program.</em>
</p>

<p>
Consider the simple issue of reading a character from the user.
We cannot simply have a function <code>readChar :: Char</code>,
because it needs to return a different character each time it
is called, depending on the input from the user.  It is an
essential property of Haskell as a pure functional language
that all functions return the same value when called twice
with the same arguments.  But it <em>is</em> ok to have an I/O function
<code>getChar :: IO Char</code> in the <code>IO</code> monad,
because it can only be used in a sequence within the one-way
monad.  There is no way to get rid of the <code>IO</code>
type constructor in the signature of any function that uses it,
so the <code>IO</code> type constructor acts as a kind of tag
that identifies all functions that do I/O.  Furthermore, 
such functions are only useful within the <code>IO</code> monad.
So a one-way monad effectively creates an isolated computational
domain in which the rules of a pure functional language can
be relaxed.  Functional computations can move into the domain,
but dangerous side-effects and non-referentially-transparent
functions cannot escape from it.
</p>

<p>
Another common pattern when defining monads is to represent
monadic values as functions.  Then when the value of a monadic
computation is required, the resulting monad is "run" to
provide the answer.
</p>

<a name="zero"><h2>Zero and Plus</h2></a>

<p>
Beyond the three monad laws stated above, some monads obey additional laws.
The monads have a special value <code>mzero</code> and an operator
<code>mplus</code> that obey four additional laws:
<ol>
<li><code>mzero >>= f == mzero</code></li>
<li><code>m >>= (\x -> mzero) == mzero</code></li>
<li><code>mzero `mplus` m == m</code></li>
<li><code>m `mplus` mzero == m</code></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
It is easy to remember the laws for <code>mzero</code> and <code>mplus</code>
if you associate <code>mzero</code> with 0, <code>mplus</code> with +,
and <code>>>=</code> with &times; in ordinary arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
Monads which have a zero and a plus can be declared as instances of the
<code>MonadPlus</code> class in Haskell:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
class (Monad m) => MonadPlus m where
    mzero :: m a
    mplus :: m a -> m a -> m a
</pre></td></tr></table>  
</p>

<p>
Continuing to use the <code>Maybe</code> monad as an example, we see that
the <code>Maybe</code> monad is an instance of <code>MonadPlus</code>:
<table bgcolor="#bbaa55" width="100%"><tr><td><pre>
instance MonadPlus Maybe where
    mzero             = Nothing
    Nothing `mplus` x = x
    x `mplus` _       = x
</pre></td></tr></table>
This identifies <code>Nothing</code> as the zero value and says that
adding two <code>Maybe</code> values together gives the first
value that is not <code>Nothing</code>.  If both input values are
<code>Nothing</code>, then the result of <code>mplus</code> is
also <code>Nothing</code>.  
</p>

<p>
The List monad also has a zero and a plus.  <code>mzero</code> is the
empty list and <code>mplus</code> is the <code>++</code> operator.
</p>

<p>
The <code>mplus</code> operator is used to combine monadic values from
separate computations into a single monadic value.  Within the context
of our sheep-cloning example, we could use <code>Maybe</code>'s
<code>mplus</code> to define a function,
<code>parent&nbsp;s&nbsp;=&nbsp;(mother&nbsp;s)&nbsp;`mplus`&nbsp;(father&nbsp;s)</code>,
which would return a parent if there is one, and <code>Nothing</code> is the sheep has no parents at all.
For a sheep with both parents, the function would return one or the
other, depending on the exact definition of <code>mplus</code> in the
<code>Maybe</code> monad.
</p>

<a name="summary"><h2>Summary</h2></a>

<p>
Instances of the <code>Monad</code> class should conform to the 
so-called monad laws, which describe algabraic properties of
monads.  There are three of these laws which state that
the <code>return</code> function is both a left and a right
identity and that the binding operator is associative.
Failure to satisfy these laws will result in monads that
do not behave properly and may cause subtle problems when
using do-notation.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the <code>return</code> and <code>>>=</code> functions,
the <code>Monad</code> class defines another function, <code>fail</code>.
The <code>fail</code> function is not a technical requirement for
inclusion as a monad, but it is often useful in practice and it
is included in the <code>Monad</code> class because it is used
in Haskell's do-notation.
</p>

<p>
Some monads obey laws beyond the three basic monad laws.  An important
class of such monads are ones which have a notion of a zero element
and a plus operator.  Haskell provides a <code>MonadPlus</code> class
for such monads which define the <code>mzero</code> value and the
<code>mplus</code> operator.
